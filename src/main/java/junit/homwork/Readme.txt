1. I used unit testing and exploratory testing for this.

2. In first test case,I write test for camel case text.
   In second test case,I write test for change the string.
   In third test case,I write test to check valid Email address.

3. In second test case where we need to change name from Johan to nahoJ i find error because we define method for lower case and in this we are writing capital J that is not accepted and it is showing error so to fix this bug we need to change name from nahoJ to nahoj before the production.

4. It was interesting.
